- Opening an account and adding a project through the firebase console has ended
- Now we are going to create a flutter app on our IDE. I prefer Visual Studio Code IDE for my flutter projects, if you use another IDE for flutter projects Ex: Android Studio or Intellij IDEA you can skip the Visual Studio Code Download Operations

### 2- Visual Studio Code Download Operations

- first of all operations you should download flutter SDK from the link below ðŸ‘‡
- SDK Link: [https://flutter.dev](https://flutter.dev) 
- Then if you dont have Visual Studio Code IDE on your computer you can go to the following link to download and install it ðŸ‘‰ [Link](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
- After finishing download and install operations on Visual Studio Code open Visual Studio Code app, Click to Extensions part and type [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) to search bar
- Then click download button, it will automatically download the Dart Extension too
- But if you have a problem you can type [Dart](https://dart.dev/) and click download

### 3- Creating a new flutter project & Connecting to firebase

- After finishing the Visual Studio Code installing app and Extensions, Click Ctrl+Shift+P to open terminal and click Flutter New Project as below ðŸ‘‡

#### After that follow the following steps below

### 4- Adding a firebase project & Conecting it with our flutter App

- After finishing create account operations on firebase console, it will redirect you to homepage of your project
- Select here Android icon as you see in the upper photo
- I prefer here Android because i use Windows as OS (Operating System), if you use Mac Os you should select IOS, Also this project made for android, meaning these steps will not work with IOS

- In our flutter app we will open Android -> App -> build.gradle file
- Then as you see in the upper photo we will copy The Text inside double quotes
- Ex: "com.example.flutter_firebase_web_app"
